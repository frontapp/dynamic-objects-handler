# Front Dynamic Object Handler on Vercel Node

This sample project demonstrates how you can configure a server to verify that incoming requests are coming from Front, and then pass information from an API response to a dynamic object in Front.

This allows you to augment the information that a dynamic object presents to Front users by adding additional fields other than a title and link to an external record, such as additional IDs, statuses, notes, assignees, and anything else stored in the external system.
