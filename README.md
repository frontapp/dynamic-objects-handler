# Front Application Object Handler on Vercel Node

This sample project demonstrates how you can configure a server to verify that incoming requests are coming from Front, and then pass information from an API response to an application object in Front.

This allows you to augment the information that an application object presents to Front users by adding additional fields other than a title and link to an external record, such as additional IDs, statuses, notes, assignees, and anything else stored in the external system.

**Note:** You'll see "dynamic object" terminology in this repo. This is because application objects were previously named dynamic objects.
